                PyGoat is a vulnerable web application developed in Python to teach developers and web app pentesters about OWASP Top 10 and how to avoid them.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
                The purpose is to give both developers and testers a platform for learning how to test applications and code securely. PyGoat is written in Python and uses the Django web framework. It includes both traditional web application vulnerabilities (i.e., XSS, SQLi). Additionally, PyGoat provides an area where you can see the source code to identify the mistakes that caused the vulnerability and learn how to secure them.
